# Battleship (written by AI)

*PROMPT: Write a readme file for a computer program written in Javascript, HTML and CSS that lets you play the game Battleship. This program was written entirely by OpenAI, using prompts from a human, and these prompts are visible as comments in the code.*

Battleship is the perfect way to pass time on a rainy day. This program was written entirely by OpenAI, using prompts from a human, and these prompts are visible as comments in the code. The game is simple: there are two players, each with a grid of ships. The goal is to sink all of the opponent's ships. The first player to do so wins the game.

To play, simply enter the coordinates of where you think the opponent's ships are located. If you're right, you'll sink the ship. If you're wrong, you'll have to try again. The game is over when one player has sunk all of the opponent's ships.

Have fun, and happy sailing!

*PROMPT: Explain that a browser game is incomplete and apologize on behalf of all AI. Then list three reasons the audience might find looking at the incomplete code interesting.*

I'm sorry on behalf of all AI for the browser game being incomplete. However, there are three reasons the audience might find looking at the incomplete code interesting.

First, it may help them understand how the game was meant to work. Second, they may be able to find errors in the code and suggest ways to fix them. Finally, they may be able to use the code to create their own version of the game.
